## Philosophy

The guidelines are extracted from real problems we encountered and the
solutions we have found along the way. These guidelines should be used as a
default unless there is a good reason against it.

## Contribute

These guidelines are created with the help of the whole organization. Anyone is
welcome to open a PR to any section of the guidelines.

Anything added to the guideline must have been extracted from a project.

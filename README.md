# Abtion Guidelines

## Philosophy

The guidelines are extracted from real problems we encountered and the solutions we have found along the way. These guidelines should be used as a default unless there is a good reason against it.

## Contribute

These guidelines are created with the help of the whole organization. Anyone is welcome to open a PR to any section of the guidelines.

Anything added to the guideline must have been extracted from a project.

## Abtion x AI

Recently, we powered up our guidelines with ChatGPT to create [AbtionGPT](https://inside.abtion.com/artificial_intelligence/abtion_gpt). The goal is to make it easier for you to find the information you need.

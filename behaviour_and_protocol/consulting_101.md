Consulting 101
==============

Introduction to Consulting
--------------------------

As a consulting company, we are fortunate to have collaborated with a wide range of companies over the years from solo entrepreneurs to large Danish corporations. Key to this success is that we acknowledge that every client is different and has different needs.

If you are coming from a product company, it can be unclear what consulting is, and what your new role as a consultant requires. Our goal with this document is to provide a clearer overview of consulting. We believe that training people and bringing them closer to the client ensures that we can give clients better advice and products. 

As a reminder, please note that the following are guidelines and not strict rules.

This document is divided into the following sections:

Client Communication
--------------------

* **Recognize and understand the client's preferred communication style.**
  * If a client prefers to understand the context for your solutions in detail, provide comprehensive explanations.
* **Keep communication transparent and public.**
  * When communicating about a specific task, be sure to keep the communication in a shared platform like Slack or Asana. Ideally on the task itself.
  * Use public channels for communication to ensure transparency and alignment within the team.
* **Respond to client messages clearly and on time.**
  * If you need time to eg. analyse a task or estimate changes, it is beneficial to communicate that to the client. Example: "Thank you for your message, I will take some time to analyse and get back to you by tomorrow."
* **After a meeting, summarize key points and next steps in Slack or in Asana.**
  * This ensures documentation and a shared memory on what has been decided.

Technical Communication
----------------------------------

* **Tailor communication to the client's technical understanding.**
  * Ask the client how technical they would like the explanation to be.
  * If the client is non-technical, keep the explanations simple and eg. use metaphors.
* **Provide realistic estimates and pose potential challenges and solutions.**
  * Example: "We have estimated the SSO login as an XL-task. The documentation for the SSO is new to us, so we would have to spend some time researching. Alternatively, an email-based login would be an L-task."
* **Explain system issues, highlighting the reasons for unexpected outcomes and the steps taken to fix these.**
  * Example: "The issue occurred because the user could input text, and we were expecting numbers. We've updated the input and added additional tests."

Etiquette and Professionalism
-----------------------------

* **Punctuality for meetings.**
  * Some meetings require more preparation than others. Make sure to prepare for the meeting.
  * Example: Arrive 5-10 minutes early to setup and review meeting materials.
* **Stay professional in both physical and digital interactions.**
  * You do not need formal attire for client meetings, but you should be presentable. This also applies to your background in online meetings.
  * Your messages are a part of your professional image. Make sure they are thought-through and polite.
* **Ensure a professional setup for remote interactions.**
  * Example: Ensure the background is tidy and well-lit for video meetings.
* **Keep track of time spent on projects accurately and consistently.**
  * Log your hours daily to maintain accurate project timelines and budgeting.

Proactiveness
-----------------------

* **Be proactive in identifying and addressing potential issues or enhancements.**
  * Example: "I noticed this process could be optimized to reduce steps and improve efficiency."
* **Engage in proactive communication while being mindful of the implementation's impact.**
  * Example: Before implementing a change, discuss potential impacts with the client and team.

Solution-Oriented Approach
--------------------------

* **Avoid outright denials when addressing client requests; instead, propose alternative solutions or phased approaches.**
  * Avoid: "That's impossible."
  * Try: "That's challenging, but let's explore some alternatives that might work."
* **Suggest a Proof of Concept (POC) for technically challenging or untested solutions to demonstrate if they're feasible.**
  * Example: "We can develop a small POC to test this approach within a week."

Understanding the Client’s Perspective
-------------------------------------------

* **View and assess the platform from the client's perspective to better understand their needs.**
  * You might find new features or improvements that the client has not thought of.
  * Example: Regularly use the client's platform yourself to identify areas for improvement.
* **Focus on delivering features that not only meet technical specifications but also help the client's user experience.**
  * Example: "This feature was designed with your team's workflow in mind, reducing the steps required to achieve the result."

Client-Specific Insights
------------------------

* **Understand Client Preferences.**
  * Continuously engage with clients to learn about their preferences and operational styles.
  * Example: Some clients prefer regular Show and Tell-meetings to stay updated on project progress.
* **Match the Client's Tone and preferred communication.**
  * Use insights gained from interactions to refine communication methods.
  * Example: Some clients prefer direct and concise communication, while others prefer detailed explanations.
  * Example: Some clients like visual representations, while others prefer written explanations.

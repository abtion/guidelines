# Collective ownership
Collective ownership gives control of the entire project to all team members. "Your part" is the product. Either it's a good product, or it is not. 

## Collective vision
- Open communication: No privileged information.
- Cut the middle person. We put the team directly in front of the stakeholder.
- Break knowledge silos. No one is "the expert" in an area.

## Collective accountability
- Work end-to-end. We need to be able to impact as much of the project as possible.
- T-shape profiles. We still have roles, and they know about areas surrounding their expertise.
- Integrated Q&A. The team takes direct responsibility for the work they've created.

## Collective contribution
- Pairing. Team members work simultaneously on the same tasks.
- Simplicity. We want people to be able to chip in.

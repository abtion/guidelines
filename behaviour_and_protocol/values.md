Values are pointless if not put into practice. Our values are reflected in the following behaviors.

# Collective ownership
Collective ownership gives control of the entire project to all team members. "Your part" is the product. Either it's a good product, or it is not. 

## Collective vision
- Communicate openly. No privileged information. Everyone should have the same basis for decision making.
- Cut the middle person. We put the team directly in front of the stakeholder.
- Break knowledge silos. No one is "the expert" in an area.

## Collective accountability
- Work end-to-end. We need to be able to impact as much of the project as possible.
- T-shape profiles. We still have roles, and they know about areas surrounding their expertise.
- Integrated QA. The team takes direct responsibility for the work they've created.

## Collective contribution
- Pair up! Team members work simultaneously on the same tasks.
- Keep it simple. We want people to be able to pitch in.

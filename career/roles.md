They may lead a team during the development phase.
Business development engineers focus on a few clients so that they can stay close to the technical implementation, the industry, and the people behind the solution.  They work with long-term clients to engage in long-term collaboration rather than trying to establish new relationships.
They collaborate with sales, solution architects (tech leads), and UXers to find the best recommendations for the client through workshops. Later on, they work with a development team (UI, developers) to implement the solution. 

Business development engineers are firstly evaluated as software engineers. Other KPIs involve client satisfaction and rebizz.

# Engineering Management Career Ladder

This career ladder serves to give an overview of how you can progress your
career at Abtion and become an Engineering Manager (EM).

As a prerequisite, we require people to have moved beyond level 2 on our
[individual contributor (IC) career
ladder](https://github.com/abtion/guidelines/blob/main/career/ladder.md) before
they can transition into a role as an Engineering Manager. This is required as
we believe it is important that you have grown your technical skills to a
certain level before you start leading highly technical individuals.

Engineering managers are expected to be able to check off most items under
"Impactful", "Simple", "Communication" and "Respectful teammate" for the
corresponding level in the [IC career
ladder](https://github.com/abtion/guidelines/blob/main/career/ladder.md).
Although you will not be evaluated on your ability to test highly complex logic,
we believe testing is an essential engineering practice that you will continue
honing and teaching.

While the engineering management track includes non-development tasks, it is
worth pointing out that most of your time will still be spent on development and
other client-focused work. You will gradually spend more time on managerial
tasks as you move up the career ladder but check the "Time expectation" section
under each level to see how your time will be split. EM-related tasks include,
but are not limited to, 360 reviews, 1-on-1s, administrative work and attending
engineering management meetings.

Any feedback on this career ladder is appreciated, and we encourage that you
make pull requests with suggestions for improvements.

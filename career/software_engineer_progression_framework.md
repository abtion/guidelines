# Software Engineer // Progression Framework

The progression framework is a tool for the individual contributor to see where their responsibilities lie and what they should be focusing on in their current role.
It gives an overview of a developer’s progression through their time in Abtion.

We know that there are as many combinations of skill sets as there are people; The framework is not meant to be a perfectly precise description of reality but is meant as a guideline for developers. 

The framework is comprised of six roles:
- [Associate Software Engineer](#associate-software-engineer)
- [Software Engineer](#software-engineer)
- [Seasoned Software Engineer](#seasoned-software-engineer)
- [Senior Software Engineer](#senior-software-engineer)
- [Lead Software Engineer](#lead-software-engineer)
- [Principal Software Engineer](#principal-software-engineer)

Each role contains descriptions of what is expected from an employee.
When taking on a new role, all the descriptions from previous roles still apply. 

The descriptions are split into the following categories:

### Scope
The scope describes what part of a project’s life cycle the employee is expected to participate in or drive.

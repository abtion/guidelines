## What is a Product Manager in Abtion?

  

There are almost as many different definitions of the product manager role as companies with product managers. Following is the definition of a product manager in Abtion:

  

As a product manager in Abtion you are the glue that binds together all the functions that touch a product—sales, research, design, engineering, client success, operations, and finance.

  

Unlike a traditional project manager, who is primarily focused on execution and measured by the on-time delivery of projects, you, as a product manager, are more like a mini-CEO of the products you are responsible for. You wear many hats, use a broad knowledge base to make trade-off decisions, and bring together cross-functional teams, ensuring alignment between diverse functions.

  

As a product manager you first and foremost act as a mediator between the end-users, the client and your development team. You identify and communicate the end-user needs to the client. You translate the needs into product features, and you advise on the impact, cost and priority of the features.

  

A product manager is a “priority manager”. While needs change and evolve, you are ultimately judged on what you say "no" to, just as much as tasks you say “yes” to. Every project will have limited resources and time, so you must be resolute when prioritizing tasks and balancing the end-users' needs with the time and budget.

  
  

As a product manager, you move on two speeds: you plan the daily or weekly feature releases, as well as the product roadmap for the next three to 18 months. You don't write long requirements upfront; instead, you work closely with our clients and teams to gather feedback and iterate frequently.

  

As seamless, user-friendly consumer software permeates our lives, business users increasingly expect a better experience for enterprise software. Therefore, the product manager needs to know the end-users of a product in-depth. This means diving into usage metrics and building user empathy through online channels, one-on-one interviews, and shadowing exercises to observe, listen, and learn how people actually use and experience products.

  

As the products we build are often just one element in an ecosystem of related services and businesses, you are also responsible for identifying and owning key partnerships, managing the whole ecosystem. As a product manager, you spend a lot of your time on external activities like engaging with clients and the partner ecosystem and connect directly with end-users rather than extracting feedback through multiple layers of sales and intermediaries.

  

Leaders create a vision and strategy. Managers handle the implementation. As a product manager, you need to combine the two roles to focus on the end goal while driving teams through the process.

  

This means having strong, soft skills to keep teams on track. You must understand and anticipate the needs of your team members, and use empathy to get the best out of them.

  

As a product manager, you must be able to handle conflict when it occurs with a calm attitude. You mentor and coach your team members. You problem-solve in a positive manner and use corrective measures in a way that allows people to maintain their dignity.

  
  
  
  
  

## Ladder

  
  

### L1 - Associate Product Manager

  

As an associate product manager, you demonstrate that you understand the product manager role and have a clear interest in solving end-user needs. It's about demonstrating your empathy for the user, highlighting your ability to identify issues and opportunities, and collaborating with others.

  

You can prioritize tasks with a defined set of constraints. You make scoping and prioritization decisions by hearing all sides of a story, you synthesize and assess the different perspectives, and arrive at a clear conclusion.

  

You balance the business objectives with the end user's needs and reconcile goals with benefits (you'll always ask yourself if a feature is essential. If so, why? How is it solving a user problem and moving the needle for the business?).

  

You can speak to the "this is what we're doing and why we're doing it" question, and you rely on metrics to find out when your team is successful.

  

When you are ready to move from associate product manager to product manager, you have established yourself as the "go-to" person for your product set and have developed a strong working relationship with engineering, design, and stakeholders.

  

You are comfortable delegating some of your tasks to someone else and trust the process you've helped establish. You can speak to what is needed in the associate role in order to mentor your replacement.

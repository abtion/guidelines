# 1password

All credentials and sensitive information used by a team must be hosted on 1password. 
See [Access and Permissions](https://github.com/abtion/guidelines/blob/main/tools_and_services/access_and_permissions.md) for more on how we organize vaults.
Note that external members can be invited to the vault. It is common to share a vault with a client's team.
If someone from Abtion needs access to information stored in the vault, the person should request access to the vault. 

# Abtion's best-kept secret

When we need to share sensitive information with someone who is not part of 1password, we use secret.abtion.com. 
There, we can put any text and generate a safe link that can only be seen once and expires in 24 hours if it's not opened in that time. 
Note that we need to inform the client on how the webpage works. Remember to ask the receiver to store the shared information safely.

# How to Purchase Licenses or Memberships
_and how to document them_

This document describes how to purchase, manage, and document software licenses and memberships at Abtion. The goal is to ensure transparency, smooth onboarding/offboarding, and clear ownership.

## 1. Approval

Before purchasing a license or membership, ask for approval when needed.

## 2. Determine the License Type

Before creating any accounts, decide whether the license is for a **project** or an **individual**.

### A. Project License

Use this when the license is shared by a team or tied to a specific project.

- The account **must be created under the project email group**
- Example: `name-of-project@abtion.com`

### B. Individual License

Use this when the license is strictly personal (e.g. Grammarly, Workflowy).

- The account can be created using the person’s **own Abtion email**

## 3. Billing & Invoices

All invoices **must be forwarded to**:

`billing+name-of-project+name-of-service@abtion.com` or `billing+persons-email-initials+name-of-service@abtion.com`

E.g. `billing+dao+sentry@abtion.com` or `billing+hc+grammarly@abtion.com`

## 4. Payment Method

Use the **card credentials stored in 1Password**:

- Vault: **Shared Vault**
- Entry: `admin+billing@abtion.com`

> For larger purchases, Pleo may require **2FA verification**.

## 5. Update the License Overview (Asana)

All licenses must be documented in the Asana board:

https://app.asana.com/0/1149529931138025/list

### Choose the correct section
- **Internal licenses**  
Shared internal tools and services
- **Individual licenses**  
Licenses for personal use (e.g. Grammarly, Workflowy)
- **Projects**  
Create a dedicated section per project for clear hand-off and overview

## 6. Shared Ownership & Maintenance

This board relies on **shared ownership**.

When you purchase a license, you are responsible for:
- Adding it to the Asana overview
- Keeping it up to date

This includes:
- Upgrading or downgrading licenses
- Reassigning licenses when switching projects
- Cancelling licenses that are no longer needed

Before requesting a new license:
- Check the board to see if one already exists

If you notice missing or outdated licenses, add or update them accordingly.

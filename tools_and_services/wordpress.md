## WordPress

WordPress is a whole separate ecosystem from the rest of the tech we are using.
Therefore here's a guideline specifically for that.

### Tools

- 游릭 [GitHub](https://github.com) - Versioning of development

#### Hosting
- 游릭 [Pressable](https://my.pressable.com) - Hosting of staging and livesites. We should use Pressable for all new Wordpress clients

- 游리 [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com) - Hosting of staging and livesites. We use Kinsta for old projects, and should try to move them to Pressable, when we actively develop for them.

### Plugins

- 游리 [ManageWP Worker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/worker) - Overview, backup and updating of existing websites. We have been using this system for managing wordpress sites, but now we are moving away from it, and updating sites manually first on Staging and then on Production.

Recommended way of building new wordpress projects is by using Gutenberg, and creating Abtion's plugin for components.

#### Translations

# Employee Manual Abtion 

## Introduction
Welcome to Abtion's employee manual. The purpose of the manual is to provide you with practical information about your workplace, and the company culture.

We ask you to read the manual thoroughly and encourage you to reach out to your colleagues if you like us to elaborate on something or miss an answer to.

Happy reading!

## Our values
At Abtion we believe in the individual's ability to take responsibility and desire to do its best. Therefore, we want our behavior and work to be governed by values rather than rules. 

We wish that everyone at Abtion strives to be:

- ambitious
- competent
- value-creating
- effective

… and at the same time have fun. 
It should be fun and enjoyable to go to work in Abtion. If something comes in the way of fun, if it's suddenly not enjoyable to go to the office, it is important that you draw attention to it, so we can take care of the problem together.

## Critique care and code of conduct

### Critique

As thinkers and doers, we will engage in group critiques from time to time. We believe it helps to improve and support our work, with the goal to inspire and motivate individuals and teamwork. When giving feedback, remember to critique the work and praise the person. Be clear and constructive in your direction, offering relevant ideas when possible. When receiving feedback, have an open mind, listen to the feedback and ask for more clarity when needed.

- Have a look at 'Behaviour and protocol' to get an idea of our Rule of Thumbs in regard to communication and feedback. 

### Conduct

Everyone at Abtion treats each other with the utmost respect, considering each other's privacy, space, beliefs and customs. Not only in our own team but also towards clients and partners outside Abtion. We provide a work environment free of discrimination and harassment, where all national origins, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities or marital statuses are respected. 

We prohibit unwelcome sexual advances, requests and other verbal or physical harassment. In our environment we can speak freely and are able to express ourselves. We intend pleasant collaborations and provide a helping hand when desired. 

Physical and verbal violence are not included on our list of healthy and mature working methods. 
Do not use, possess, or sell illegal drugs on Abtion’s property and falsification of documents or records is, of course, illegal.

## Pension

Meeting with Sampension
After your first 3 months in Abtion, you become a member of our Health care and pension plan with Sampension. When being a part of the plan, you will get contacted by Sampension to book a counselling meeting. This will automatically happen after they have received your first payment. This payment has a standard of 8%, 6% by you and 2% by Abtion. 

So just sit back and relax, and wait for a phone call or email from Sampension. Do you have any questions in the meantime? Angelle knows all the answers.

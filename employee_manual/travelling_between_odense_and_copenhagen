# Travelling between Odense and Copenhagen

When traveling between our offices, use the train as far as possible.

Schedule your trip so that it disturbs yourself and your team as little as possible, e.g., avoid traveling in the middle of the workday but aim to travel out in the morning and home in the afternoon.

Use the train journey as productively as possible when traveling within working hours. Avoid interfering with each other's work when more people travel together.

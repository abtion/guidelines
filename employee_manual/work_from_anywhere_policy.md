# Work from anywhere policy 1.0

In Abtion, you can work from anywhere. It’s freedom with responsibility, and this is what is expected of you:

### Put Abtion's interests first
- Put Abtion’s interest first when deciding on working remotely. 
We trust you with your judgment. Some meetings are better when the whole team is in the same location.
- If you plan to go abroad or work remotely for a more extended period, you must always clear it with your manager in advance. 
You also need to make sure that your team members know and approve your plan.
- When working remotely, you must let your team and other relevant colleagues know when you stop for the day 10 minutes in advance so they can catch you for a talk if they need to.
Keep our working hours sacred. Start your working day between 07:30 and 09:00 am, and finish between 3:30 and 5:00 pm UTC+01:00 (depending on when you started).
- Don’t travel (unless it is work-related) and run personal errands during working hours. Exceptions are doctor visits, examinations, and treatments where it is impossible to get an appointment outside working hours.
- Make sure that it is without negative consequences for our ability to appear dependable and professional in the eyes of our clients and other external partners that you work remote.
- If you plan to go abroad or work remotely for a more extended period, you must always clear it with your manager in advance. You also need to make sure that your team members know and approve your plan.

### Be aware of your environments and pracitical challenges
- Make sure that your remote workplace is comfortable and distraction-free
- Make sure your internet connection is stable and fast enough to run a video meeting without interruptions.
- Make sure you can stay on the same site the entire working day, so you do not have to move to a new location in the middle of the day.
- Update your location in your google calender so all team members can see wether you are working form one of our offices or elsewhere.
- Notify the officemanager to cancel lunch at the office
- Remember your charger(s), headphones, and whatever other equipment you need to perform your work tasks without loss of productivity.
- Make sure to come to the office and meet your colleagues as much as possible. Culture and friendships grow and thrive best when we meet physically.

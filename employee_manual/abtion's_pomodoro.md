Talking about time, our working days include pomodoro. Because the secret to effective time management is...thinking in tomatoes rather than hours. It may seem silly at first, but it works!

- 🍅 Your flow and ability to focus will improve.
- 🍅 You get the necessary breaks.
- 🍅 No one bothers you when you are in the pomodoro cycle.

We have our own internal pomodoro space! Here you can start your own popodoro cycle, join others in their cycle, see what people are working on, and see who is running the most pomodoro's. A great tool to manage your time, and to be enganged in some gamification. 

You can enter the [pomodoro dashboard](https://pomodoro.abtion.com/spaces) with your working email.

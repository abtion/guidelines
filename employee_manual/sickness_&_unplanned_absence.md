# Sickness & unplanned absence

## Sickness
When you are sick, notify your manager and the project team you are currently working with as soon as possible and no later than 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. In the meantime set your Slack status to “Off sick”.

## Child’s first sick day
In the event of an acute sickness, one parent has the right to take time off work if their presence is absolutely necessary. This also applies if your child is injured at school or daycare.

The absence is of short duration, 1st day of sickness, until you have been able to take other precautions in relation to the acutely occurring sickness. It is stated in the law on employees’ right to absence from work for special family reasons.

In any case, it is important that you notify your employer as soon as possible before you should have arrived at work.

## Loss
In case of loss Abtion supports your absence and allows you to stay home as long as needed with full salary. This concerns closely related family members (children, parents, siblings or partner). In other cases your absence will be deducted from salary or vacation days.

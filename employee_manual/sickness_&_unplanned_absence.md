# Sickness & unplanned absence

## Sickness
When you are sick, notify your manager and the project team you are currently working with as soon as possible and no later than 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. In the meantime set your Slack status to “Off sick”.

## Child’s first and second sick day
If your child is ill, you have the right to two days of paid leave from the first day of the illness. Make sure to let your team and/or manager know about your absence in due time, and update your slack status accordingly.

## Loss
In the event of a death in the household (partner or child) you are entitled to 26 weeks (6 months) of fully paid leave. This is in line with the regulations for bereavement leave, which is the period during which reimbursement is available in connection with the death of a child: https://www.borger.dk/sundhed-og-sygdom/doedsfald--hospice-og-behandlingstestamente/sorgorlov

In case of other serious events such as divorce or the loss of a close relative, we'll figure out an individual arrangement to suit the situation.

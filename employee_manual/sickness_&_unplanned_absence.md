# Sickness & unplanned absence

## Sickness
When you are sick, notify your manager and the project team you are currently working with as soon as possible and no later than 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. In the meantime set your Slack status to “Off sick”.

## Child’s first and second sick day
If your child is ill, you have the right to two days of paid leave from the first day of the illness. Make sure to let your team and/or manager know about your absence in due time, and update your slack status accordingly.

## Loss
In case of loss Abtion supports your absence and allows you to stay home as long as needed with full salary. This concerns closely related family members (children, parents, siblings or partner). In other cases your absence will be deducted from salary or vacation days.

# Vacation and time off

## Taking time off
Don‚Äôt be shy and remember to use your vacation time! We believe it helps to motivate, inspire and refocus. 

Abtion provides 25 vacation days per year. While only working 4 days a week, this actually holds 6 weeks of holiday per year, given that one only uses 4 vacation days for a full week of vacation. 

When you are employed with payment during vacation, you receive a holiday allowance of 1% of your salary. This is in addition to your regular salary. 
All days and calculations are provided following the Danish Holiday Rights 'Dansk ferielov‚Äô. It is your own responsibility, to make sure you use all your holiday days before the new year starts and to check the entitled payments. 

### Planning your holiday
The sooner you notify us of your request, the higher the chance of appoval gets. Notify us as soon as possible, so we can do our best to make sure you can enjoy your desired time off.

Our rules of thumb:
- A single day off should be requested minimum 7 days in advance.
- Vacation (several days in a row) should be requested minimum 3 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Vacation of 1-3 weeks should be requested a minimum of 8 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Please inform our traffic manager about your request by writing her on slack.
- Change your slack status to 'off - vacation' so we can respect your time off

To make the traffic smooth please follow this order:

 1. Check with your PM - they will let you know and book your vacation in forecast. If you for some reason have no PM in the given period, check with your manager or Angelle

 2. Create an out-of-office event in your calendar so we know you‚Äôre unavailable. For extra credit set your slack status to ‚ÄúOn holiday‚Äù, clear it when you‚Äôre back.

 3. Track the time in harvest as ‚ÄúPlanned vacation‚Äù under ‚ÄúVacation‚Äù BEFOREHAND. Put 7,5h pr day - as always a week should amount to 30h

üëâüèª Remember that you have to keep an eye on your remaining saved holiday-days yourself. [Borger.dk](https://privat.atp.dk/Ferieplanlaeggeren/borger) can give you a hand with planning your holiday. And if you have any questions, reach out to your manager or Angelle.

### Forced vacation days
We also demand you to take some days off. Some days can slightly vary year to year, depending on which week day a public holiday falls. The Abtion calendar gives you the most accurate overview of all holidays and forced vacation days, so check the days there to be sure you are up to date.

- Week between Christmas and New Year ( + 24th of December + 31th of December )
- First friday of the year (in order to follow our standard of 6 weeks holidays per year, 24 days per year, we force you to use 1 earned holiday day on this friday.) 
 
## Absence

### Illness
When you are sick, you notify the project manager(s) you are currently working with before 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. Change your slack status too 'off sick'. 

### Child‚Äôs first sick day
In the event of an acute illness, one parent has the right to take time off work if their presence is absolutely necessary.
This also applies if your child is injured at school or daycare. 

The absence is of short duration, 1st day of illness, until you have been able to take other precautions in relation to the acutely occurring illness. It is stated in the law on employees' right to absence from work for special family reasons.

In any case, it is important that you notify your employer as soon as possible before you should have arrived at work.

### Loss
In case of loss Abtion supports your absence and allows you to stay home as long as needed with full salary. This concerns closely related family members (children, parents, siblings or partner). In other cases your absence will be deducted from salary or vacation days. 

### Parental leave
In Denmark you have the right to take maternity and paternity leave at work. At Abtion you do too.  Both mothers and fathers can leave for childbirth following the Danish rules of parental leave, ‚ÄúBarselsloven‚Äù.

Abtion gives you 14 weeks of leave with a full salary up to max. 40.000 kr. per month.

This is a huge jump for us, and we are happy it is possible. But in order to make it sustainable for us, it is also a term that Abtion can get the normal refund from the government and barsel.dk. So be aware, your partner might have used this initially.

You still have the right to leave for a longer period of time, but without salary. You might even still have the right to get some payment from the authorities in an additional period of time.

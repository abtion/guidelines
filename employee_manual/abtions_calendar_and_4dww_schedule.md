# Schedule, calendar and 4dww

## Only 4 days a week
We have implemented 4 day work week! Meaning, we work 30 hours from Monday to Thursday. In order to make the 4dww successful, we align our schedules.
- Meet at work earliest at 7:30 and latest at 9:00. 
- Your day finishes after 7,5 hours of work excluding a 30 min lunch break from 11.30 -12.00.

We only work 4 days a week by default, and have Fridays off. There are 2 exceptions we'd like you to be aware of, as first, we have 5 internal days per year which will be held on Fridays. Those are mandatory for all employees, but don't worry.. they are FUN! Second, when a public holiday takes place on a weekday from Monday to Thursday, we will use Friday as a compensation day to keep 4 working days per week.

One extra day of weekend gives more value then you might think. It really gives you this extra time to fully reload and start the news week fresh and energised. This extra free time comes along with more focus on effeciency during your working days. Plan your time at the hairdresser, dentist or other non-urgent appointments on Fridays and dedicate your time at work effectively from Monday to Thursday. 

## Use your calendar

### Google Calender
We use Google Calendar as a common calendar platform. Make sure that your calendar is up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible, so it's easy for your colleagues to see when you are available. Write in your calendar if you are not in the office / have an appointment that affects your availability. It makes it so much easier to coordinate meetings. 

As part of the 4dww, we shorten our meetings and make sure to keep them effective. We book each other for short 20 minutes meetings or long 50 minutes meetings. When booking a meeting, add an agenda with topics and action points. Also remember to answer all calendar invitations so the organizer does not have to follow up on your attendance. 

- Have a look at ‚Äò[Good meeting practices](https://inside.abtion.com/behaviour_and_protocol/good_meetings_practices.html)‚Äô to be fully prepared and to be a 'pro' meeting practitioner.

We'd like you to implement:
- Add [Abtion's calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YWJ0aW9uLmNvbV9ydHBlZDI3MnUwbG1vMm1hdWVrcDkxaTI5a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to your own google calender to stay on point with public holidays, free days, internal days and birthdays
- Turn on 'effective meetings' in your calendar settings and set 20 min as default for scheduling meetings

## Awareness of our precious time
To be sure we use our time sufficiently, get paid for the work we deliver, continuously getting better at estimating project and to make sure we don't work too less/much, we track all of our working hours. Time tracking has nothing to do with surveillance or performance monitoring. It is simply a matter of getting our principles right in regard to our 4 dww, our invoices and proposals.

Therefore an introduction to our way of tracking time right down here: 

### Time tracking in Harvest
We track 30 hours per week, equivalent to 7,5 hours per day (excluding lunch breaks) and aim to have an avarage billable rate >90%. 
Flexing is not really our 'thing' and we expect you to track 30h by the end of the week. To make sure working hours don't go to waste, we submit our timesheet Thursday afternoon before you leave the office. (.. Yes, it is amazing! Your weekend starts on Thursday afternoon)

Time tracking happens right from the moment you start working and finished when you finish your day. Sounds perhaps a little strict, but it works. It creates more awareness of the time you use at work. This would give you a good indication of a satisfying and sufficient day, or a less satisfying day being unsure where you used your time on. And as important, it ensures that all our billable working hours are registered. Because this is the only way, we get money in the bank. 

### Pomodoro.abtion.com
Talking about time, our working days include pomodoro. Because the secret to effective time management is...thinking in tomatoes rather than hours. It may seem silly at first, but it works!

- üçÖ Your flow and ability to focus will improve.
- üçÖ You get the necessary breaks.
- üçÖ No one bothers you when you are in the pomodoro cycle.

We have our own internal pomodoro space! Here you can start your own popodoro cycle, join others in their cycle, see what people are working on, and see who is running the most pomodoro's. A great tool to manage your time, and to be enganged in some gamification. 

You can enter the [pomodoro dashboard](https://pomodoro.abtion.com/spaces) with your working email. 

## Taking time off
Don‚Äôt be shy and remember to use your vacation time! We believe it helps to motivate, inspire and refocus. 

Abtion provides 25 vacation days per year. While only working 4 days a week, this actually holds 6 weeks of holiday per year, given that one only uses 4 vacation days for a full week of vacation. 

When you are employed with payment during vacation, you receive a holiday allowance of 1% of your salary. This is in addition to your regular salary. 
All days and calculations are provided following the Danish Holiday Rights 'Dansk ferielov‚Äô. It is your own responsibility, to make sure you use all your holiday days before the new year starts and to check the entitled payments. 

### Planning your holiday
The sooner you notify us of your request, the higher the chance of appoval gets. Notify us as soon as possible, so we can do our best to make sure you can enjoy your desired time off.

Our rules of thumb:
- A single day off should be requested minimum 7 days in advance.
- Vacation (several days in a row) should be requested minimum 3 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Vacation of 1-3 weeks should be requested a minimum of 8 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Please inform our traffic manager about your request by writing her on slack.
- Change your slack status to 'off - vacation' so we can respect your time off

To make the traffic smooth please follow this order:

  1. Make sure your holiday is OK with relevant managers/PM and ask for approval
  2. After approval, write to Angelle on slack. She is our holiday traffic manager
  3. Angelle will answer all your requests as fast as possible and book your request in Forecast
  4. You register your planned vacation or day off in Harvest: > Abtion > Absence > Planned vacation > 7,5 hours.

üëâüèª Remember that you have to keep an eye on your remaining saved holiday-days yourself. [Borger.dk](https://privat.atp.dk/Ferieplanlaeggeren/borger) can give you a hand with planning your holiday. And if you have any questions, reach out to your manager or Angelle. 

### Public paid holidays
You can find them all in our Abtion calender. Just to list them out, here is an overview:

- Nyt√•rsdag / New years day (1st of january)
- Sk√¶rtorsdag / Maundy Thursday
- Langfredag / Good Friday
- 2 p√•skedag / Easter monday
- St. Bededag / General Prayer Day
- Kristi Himmelfart / Ascension Day
- 2 pinsedag / Whit Monday
- Jul / Christmas (25th and 26th of december)
 
### Forced vacation days
We also demand you to take some days off. Some days can slightly vary year to year, depending on which week day a public holiday falls. The Abtion calendar gives you the most accurate overview of all holidays and forced vacation days, so check the days there to be sure you are up to date. 

- The Friday after Kristi Himmelfart / Ascension Day
- Week 29 and 30 
- Week between Christmas and New Year ( + 24th of December + 31th of December )
- First friday of the year (in order to follow our standard of 6 weeks holidays per year, 24 days per year, we force you to use 1 earned holiday day on this friday.) 
 
## Absence

### Illness
When you are sick, you notify the project manager(s) you are currently working with before 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. Change your slack status too 'off sick'. 

### Child‚Äôs first sick day
In the event of an acute illness, one parent has the right to take time off work if their presence is absolutely necessary.
This also applies if your child is injured at school or daycare. 

The absence is of short duration, 1st day of illness, until you have been able to take other precautions in relation to the acutely occurring illness. It is stated in the law on employees' right to absence from work for special family reasons.

In any case, it is important that you notify your employer as soon as possible before you should have arrived at work.

### Loss
In case of loss Abtion supports your absence and allows you to stay home as long as needed with full salary. This concerns closely related family members (children, parents, siblings or partner). In other cases your absence will be deducted from salary or vacation days. 

### Parental leave
In Denmark you have the right to take maternity and paternity leave at work. At Abtion you do too.  Both mothers and fathers can leave for childbirth following the Danish rules of parental leave, ‚ÄúBarselsloven‚Äù.

Abtion gives you 14 weeks of leave with a full salary up to max. 40.000 kr. per month.

This is a huge jump for us, and we are happy it is possible. But in order to make it sustainable for us, it is also a term that Abtion can get the normal refund from the government and barsel.dk. So be aware, your partner might have used this initially.

You still have the right to leave for a longer period of time, but without salary. You might even still have the right to get some payment from the authorities in an additional period of time.


## Internal days
Five times a year, we use a Friday to have an internal day. It is mandatory to participate and absence will be counted as a vacation day, unless you are absent due to sickness. We not only expect you to participate, we also realy WANT you to participate. It strengtens our company culture and relations and apprises you with information we may not get to talk so much about during regular work days. 

### Strategy day
Our first internal day of the year, can‚Äôt be more strategic and starts with a full day focusing on our vision, wheel of the year, and town hall workshops. Afterward, we round up with a cozy dinner and a social get-together. 

### Teamday
Our 2nd and 4th internal day is a full day with 50% talking business and 50% fun time! This day starts typically with breakfast, followed by a presentation/workshop. Afterward we arrange a teambuilding activity that finally ends with a cozy dinner and drinks.

### Summer and Christmas party
This half-day will be all about fun and celebration. The day starts later in the afternoon and has only one goal, being social and bonding as a team. Depending on the season, each party will have their own setup. The summer party is our 3rd internal day and speaking for itself, we finish the year with a Christmas party.

As a final initiative, we plan a 6th NON-mandatory event: Christmas hygge with Friends and Family. For this event we can invite our friends and family for some 'hygge'. The Danish tradition of celebrating ‚Äòjulefrokost‚Äô is an obvious occasion for this. 

All dates are marked in Abtion‚Äôs calendar.

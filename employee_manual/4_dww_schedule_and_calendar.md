# 4 dww schedule and calender

## Only 4 days a week
We have implemented 4 day work week! Meaning, we work 30 hours from Monday to Thursday. In order to make the 4dww successful, we align our schedules.
- Meet at work earliest at 7:30 and latest at 9:00. 
- Your day finishes after 7,5 hours of work excluding a 30 min lunch break from 11.30 -12.00.

We only work 4 days a week by default, and have Fridays off. There are 2 exceptions we'd like you to be aware of, as first, we have 5 internal days per year which will be held on Fridays. Those are mandatory for all employees, but don't worry.. they are FUN! Second, when a public holiday takes place on a weekday from Monday to Thursday, we will use Friday as a compensation day to keep 4 working days per week.

One extra day of weekend gives more value then you might think. It really gives you this extra time to fully reload and start with fresh energy on Monday. This extra free time comes along with more focus on effeciency during your working days. Plan your time at the hairdresser, dentist or other non-urgent appointments on Fridays and dedicate your time effectively when at work Monday to Thursday. 

## Use your calendar

### Google Calender
We use Google Calendar as a common calendar platform. Make sure that your calendar is up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible, so it's easy for your colleagues to see when you are available. Write in your calendar if you are not in the office / have an appointment that affects your calendar. It makes it so much easier to coordinate meetings. 

As part of the 4dww, we shorten our meetings and make sure to keep them effective. We book each other for short 20 minutes meetings or long 50 minutes meetings. When booking a meeting, add an agenda with the topics and action points. Also remember to answer all calendar invitations so the organizer does not have to follow up on your attendance. 

We'd like you to implement:
- Add Abtion's calender to your own google calender to stay on point with public holidays, free days, internal days and birthdays
- Turn on 'effective meetings' in your calendar settings and set 20 min as default for scheduling meetings

## Awareness of our precious time
To be sure we are use our time sufficiently, get paid for the work we deliver, continuously getting better at estimating project and to make sure we don't work too less/much, we track all of our time. Time tracking has nothing to do with surveillance or performance monitoring. It is simply a matter of getting our principles in regard to our 4 dww, our invoices and proposals right. 

Therefore an introduction to our way of tracking time right down here! For more clarification, search for <time tracking> in our newsletters.

### Time tracking in Harvest
We track 30 hours per week, equivalent to 7,5 hours per day (excluding lunch breaks) and aim to have an avarage billable rate >90%. 
Flexing is not really our 'thing' and we expect you to track 30h by the end of the week. To make sure wokring hours don't go to waste, we submit our timesheet Thursday afternoon before you leave the office. 

Time tracking happens right from the moment you start working and finished when you finish your day. Sounds stricked, but it works. It makes us both aware of your time, and helps us to track all the worked minutes under the right projects and tasks. 

### Pomodoro.abtion.com
Talking about time, our working days include pomodoro. Because the secret to effective time management is...thinking in tomatoes rather than hours. It may seem silly at first, but it works!

üçÖ Your flow and ability to focus will improve.
üçÖ You get the necessary breaks.
üçÖ No one bothers you when you are in the pomodoro cycle.

We have our own internal pomodoro space! Here you can start your own popodoro cycle, join others in their cycle, see where people are working on, and see who is running the most pomodoro's. A great tool to manage your time, and to be enganged in some gamification. 

You can enter the [pomodoro dashboard](https://pomodoro.abtion.com/spaces) with your working email. 

## Taking time off
Don‚Äôt be shy and remember to use your vacation time! We believe it helps to motivate, inspire and refocus. 

Abtion provides 25 vacation days per year. While only working 4 days a week, this actually holds 6 weeks of holiday per year, given that one only uses 4 vacation days for a full week of vacation.

When you are employed with payment during vacation, you receive a holiday allowance of 1% of your salary. This is in addition to your regular salary. 
All days and calculations are provided following the Danish Holiday Rights 'Dansk ferielov‚Äô. It is your own responsibility, to make sure you use all your holiday days before the new year starts and to check the entitled payments. 

### Booking holiday
The sooner you notify us of your request, the higher the chance of appoval gets. Notify us as soon as possible, so we can do our best to make sure you can enjoy your desired time off.

Our rules of thumb:
- A single day off should be requested minimum 7 days in advance.
- Vacation (several days in a row) should be requested minimum 3 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Vacation of 1-3 weeks should be requested a minimum of 8 weeks in advance, and can be rejected if the timing doesn‚Äôt allow it.
- Please inform our traffic manager about your request by writing her on slack.
- Change your slack status to 'off - vacation' so we can respect your time off

To make the traffic smooth please follow this order:

  1. Make sure your holiday is OK with relevant managers/PM and ask for approval
  2. After approval, send a mail with your request to traffic@abtion.com or write Simone on slack (She is our traffic manager)
  3. Simone will answer all your requests as fast as possible. 
  4. Simone will book your request in Forecast
  5. You register your planned vacation or day off in Harvest: > Abtion > Absence > Planned vacation > 7,5 hours.

üëâüèª Remember that you have to keep an eye on your remaining saved holiday-days yourself. [Borger.dk](https://privat.atp.dk/Ferieplanlaeggeren/borger) can give you a hand with planning your holiday. And if you have any questions, reach out to your manager or Angelle. 

### Public paid holidays
You can find them all in our Abtion calender, but just to list them out, here is an overview:

- Nyt√•rsdag / New years day (1st of january)
- Sk√¶rtorsdag / Maundy Thursday
- Langfredag / Good Friday
- 2 p√•skedag / Easter monday
- St. Bededag / General Prayer Day

- The Friday after Kristi Himmelfart / Ascension Day
- Week 29 and 30 
- Week between Christmas and New Year ( + 24th of December)

## Absence

### Illness
When you are sick, you notify the project manager(s) you are currently working with before 9am on the first day of your absence. You are not required to give further notice before you are ready to return again. Change your slack status too 'off sick'. 

### Child‚Äôs first sick day


### Loss
In case of loss Abtion supports your absence and allows you to stay home as long as needed. If your loss is close family members (children, parents, siblings or partner), Abtion will pay your absence like if you were sick. In other cases your absence will be without pay. 

### Parental leave
In Denmark you have the right to take maternity and paternity leave at work. At Abtion you do too.  Both mothers and fathers can leave for childbirth following the Danish rules of parental leave, ‚ÄúBarselsloven‚Äù.

Abtion gives you 14 weeks of leave with a full salary up to max. 40.000 kr. per month.

This is a huge jump for us, and we are happy it is possible. But in order to make it sustainable for us, it is also a term that Abtion can get the normal refund from the government and barsel.dk. So be aware, your partner might have used this initially.

You still have the right to leave for a longer period of time, but without salary. You might even still have the right to get some payment from the authorities in an additional period of time.


## Internal days
Five times a year, we use a Friday to have an internal day. Internal days will always happen on a Friday. It is mandatory to participate and we expect you to participate. If you can‚Äôt participate in a Team day, your absence is counted as a vacation day, unless you are absent due to sickness.

### Team days
For the four team days we all get together at one of our offices. The day is about team building, being together and getting to know each other even better. It is also a day, where we follow up on strategy and plans for the company. It includes a summer party and Christmas party (half days) and two team days (full days) where we focus on 50 % business and 50 % fun. 

Team days often have different agendas. But we start eating breakfast together, and end the day with dinner and drinks. Sometimes we invite an interesting person to come and give a presentation, or sometimes we go on a trip together. The goal is to have fun and improve our social relations and apprise you with plans we may not get to talk so much about during regular work days.

### Strategy day
One day a year where we work on the strategy together. A full day with a focus on our vision, wheel of the year, and town hall workshops. Afterward, we round up with a cozy dinner and a social get-together.

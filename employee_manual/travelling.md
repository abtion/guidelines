# Travelling

## Commuting to your main office
Commuting does not count as work time.

If your commute is long you might be eligible for "Deduction for transport to work" (Befordringsfradrag). More information is available at [skat.dk](https://skat.dk) (use the search feature).

## Travelling between offices
You are NOT expected to work overtime to cover time spent travelling, and Abtion will cover your expenses (get in touch with your PM for further details).

We do however ask you to make your time as productive as possible:
- Travel by train as much as possible
- Work in the train and track time accordingly
- Schedule your trip to disturb yourself and your team as little as possible
  - Aim to travel out in the morning and home in the afternoon (Avoid traveling in the middle of the workday)
- When travelling with colleagues avoid interfering with each other's work
  - If you are talking about the customer, for instance on the way to a meeting, track time on the customer
- If you've spend additional time travelling that cannot be attributed to customer work - track it under Internal > Comment, and add a comment.
  - You are NOT required to track your every action. For instance don't stop your tracker for the 5-10 minute walk from the train station to our offices - like you wouldn't stop you tracker for shorter breaks.

## Travelling to external meetings
Attempt to make your time useful in the same way as when travelling between offices.

### Travelling in your own car
In the event that your need to travel in your own car for work purposes, except from commute, Abtion will pay transport allowance according to the rates set by the Danish government. In such an event, get in touch with your nearest manager to ensure that you will be compensated accordingly.

The most recent rates can always be found at [skat.dk](https://skat.dk) (search for "tax-free transport allowance rates")

## Travelling to parties and team days
Abtion will cover your travelling expenses. Information about this is usually communicated as part of the event schedule. If in doubt, reach out to your nearest manager.

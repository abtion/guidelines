# Internal days and Community

## Internal days
Four times a year, we use a Friday to have an internal day. It is mandatory to participate and absence will be counted as a vacation day, unless you are absent due to sickness. We not only expect you to participate, we also really WANT you to participate. It strengtens our company culture and relations, and apprises you with information we may not get to talk so much about during regular work days. 


### Strategy day
Our first internal day of the year, can’t be more strategic and starts with a full day focusing on our vision, wheel of the year, and town hall workshops. This part is mandatory. Afterward, we round up with a cozy dinner and a social get-together. 


### Teamday
Our second internal day is a full day with 50% talking business and 50% fun time! This day starts typically at around 9 am in the train going either to Odense or Copenhagen. This is followed by a presentation/workshop. Afterward we arrange a teambuilding activity that finally ends with a cozy dinner and drinks.


### Summer and Christmas party
These days will be all about fun and celebration. The days starts usually starts in the morning/midday and has only one goal, being social and bonding as a team. Depending on the season, each party will have their own setup. The summer party is our third internal day and speaking for itself. We finish the year with a Christmas party.

As a final initiative, we plan a fifth NON-mandatory event: Christmas hygge with our families. For this event we can invite our family for some 'hygge', where we will decorate the two offices and finish the night of with some pizza. This is always the last Thursday in November.

All dates are marked in Abtion’s calendar. (Don't forget to add the calendar to your google calendar :))


## Abtion's culture and community
We are proud of our communinity as we are fully aware that they are a big part of our success. That's why Abtion offers support to some degree to activities who are there to bond our Abtioneers. This could be sport activities, cultural activities, a dinner or.. anything else you can think of. 

There are no rules, so feel free to think out of the box and don't hesitate to take initiative. We all love it! 


### Channels on slack
Don't know to get started? Join the initiative on slack and add yourself to our channel on slack, #abventure. That is a very good start and source of inspiration for activities and other social events. 


## Abtion after hours hydration initiative
Socializing with your colleagues Thursday after work is a cause worth supporting :v:

Two things that are good to know in that regard:
- At the office: Drinks, beers and sodas for consumption at the office are always sponsored - we’re usually well-stocked, but reach out to Katrine or Dafna, if you’re missing anything specific.
- Outside the office: When 3 or more Abtioneers get together for a Thursday drink outside the office, the first round is on Abtion - this goes whether you have a Pleo card or not, so feel free to send a mobilepay request to Dafna when needed (just remember to text her a picture of the receipt)

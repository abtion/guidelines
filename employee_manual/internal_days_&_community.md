# Internal days and Community

## Internal days
Five times a year, we use a Friday to have an internal day. It is mandatory to participate and absence will be counted as a vacation day, unless you are absent due to sickness. We not only expect you to participate, we also realy WANT you to participate. It strengtens our company culture and relations and apprises you with information we may not get to talk so much about during regular work days. 


### Strategy day
Our first internal day of the year, can’t be more strategic and starts with a full day focusing on our vision, wheel of the year, and town hall workshops. Afterward, we round up with a cozy dinner and a social get-together. 


### Teamday
Our 2nd and 4th internal day is a full day with 50% talking business and 50% fun time! This day starts typically with breakfast, followed by a presentation/workshop. Afterward we arrange a teambuilding activity that finally ends with a cozy dinner and drinks.


### Summer and Christmas party
This half-day will be all about fun and celebration. The day starts later in the afternoon and has only one goal, being social and bonding as a team. Depending on the season, each party will have their own setup. The summer party is our 3rd internal day and speaking for itself, we finish the year with a Christmas party.

As a final initiative, we plan a 6th NON-mandatory event: Christmas hygge with Friends and Family. For this event we can invite our friends and family for some 'hygge'. The Danish tradition of celebrating ‘julefrokost’ is an obvious occasion for this. 

All dates are marked in Abtion’s calendar. (Don't forget to add the calendar to your google calendar :))


## Abtion's culture and community
We are proud of our communinity as we are fully aware that they are a big part of our success. That's why Abtion offers support to some degree to activities who are there to bond our Abtioneers. This could be sport activities, cultural activities, a dinner or.. anything else you can think of. 

There are no rules, so feel free to think out of the box and don't hesitate to take initiative. We all love it! 



.... Still hesitating? That is okay, just reach out to Angelle and have a chat with her :)


### Channels on slack
Don't know to get started? Join the initiative on slack and add yourself to our channels on slack, #abventure, #cultureers, #bouldering! That is a very good start and source of inspiration for activities and other social events.

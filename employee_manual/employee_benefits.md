## Gear Plan
We all know the importance of good gear. That is why we introduce you all to our new Gear Plan. Instead of having a gear budget, we ensure everyone has the right gear to optimise workflow and efficiency. 

- Abtion provides all essential gear and adds any additional necessary gear after personal preference. 
- Gear will be provided at one of the offices and we provide gear at home when this is a necessity for our WAW. 
- A refreshment of new gear can take place after approx. 3 years, depending on the state and quality. 
- We standardise the gear packages, following the news updates and models. 
This standardised gear suggestion can be changed according to needs and offers:

For all Abtioneers:
- 1 or 2 4K Screens (LG)
- Headphones with noise cancellation on ears and mic
   - Jabra Evolve 85 over-ear 
   - OR Jabra 75 on-ear 
   - OR a personal preferred headset + modmic wired/wireless 
- Keyboard + mouse
  - Apple magic keyboard and mouse/trackpad
  - Logitech Keyboard (Ergo K860 or Solar K750) + Logitech mouse (MX Master 3)
  - Mouse mat size M or L
- Optional TwelveSouth HiRise

For developers and designers:
- Laptop

    - Mac, MBP 13’ or 16’ with touchbar
    - Windows, Lenovo Thinkpad T14 
- Additional gear such as phone, other headphones, etc. 

### setup at the office
Ideally, all desks and pairing stations have the same setup for easy use by all. Personal desks for those who work the best at their own palace. Flex desks for guests and Abtioneers who are not attached to their own desks. This can be useful when in need of a more quiet place and all meeting rooms are occupied.  Each desk consists of either 1 or 2 screens, keyboard + mouse, and optional a highrise. 

We administrate all gear in [Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/1177794690825926/1197231131487319)(both in-house gear and gear you have at home.)

When we reach the moment of replacing gear, we are looking into ways to give a 2nd life to our gear. There is a possibility to buy the gear for personal use for a, of course, reasonable deducted price. Or donate it to a fund, to sponsor those who need it. -- Any suggestions here? Shout out! Or sell it to companies like 'greenmind' who repair and re-sell used products.

## Lunch and office snacks
We plan to take a lunch break at 11.30pm. We have daily catering delivering a tasty lunch for all our employees. There is enough variety to satisfy all kinds of diets and we are very open for new proposals. Besides lunch, you can always find something to snack on or to drink in our kitchens. If there is anything missing in your preference, don’t hesitate to reach out to our office managers/snack managers. 

Another important consuming product next to food, is coffee. At Abtion we love good coffee! Our passion makes us look out for good beans to provide a decent cup. We like variety and trying out new coffee from time to time, so if you have any suggestions in regards to that, don't be shy - please share it!

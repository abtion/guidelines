# Employee benefits

## Lunch and office snacks
We plan to take a lunch break at 11.30pm. We have daily catering delivering a tasty lunch for all our employees. There is enough variety to satisfy all kinds of diets and we are very open for new proposals. Besides lunch, you can always find something to snack on or to drink in our kitchens. If there is anything missing in your preference, don’t hesitate to reach out to Angelle. 

Another important consuming product next to food, is coffee. At Abtion we love good coffee! Our passion makes us look out for good beans to provide a decent cup. We like variety and trying out new coffee from time to time, so if you have any suggestions in regards to that, don't be shy - please share it!

## Sampension
### Pension plan
When being a 100% Abtioneer (After 3 months), you become a member of our pension and 'life insurance' plan with Sampension. When being a part of the plan, you will be contacted by Sampension to arrange a counselling meeting. During this meeting you will be introduced to the benefits Sampension automatically offers as part of Abtion's agreement. In addition you get an offer to adapt your pension plan to your own preferences. 

Your onboarding starts after Sampension has received your first payment. This payment has a standard of 8%, 6% by you and 2% by Abtion. 
All you have to do is sit back and relax and wait for a phone call or email from Sampension. Do you have any questions in the meantime? Angelle knows all the answers.

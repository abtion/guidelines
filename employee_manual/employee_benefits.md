## Gear Plan
We all know the importance of good gear. That is why we introduce you all to our new Gear Plan. Instead of having a gear budget, we ensure everyone has the right gear to optimise workflow and efficiency. 

- Abtion provides all essential gear and adds any additional necessary gear after personal preference. 
- Gear will be provided at one of the offices and we provide gear at home when this is a necessity for our WAW. 
- A refreshment of new gear can take place after approx. 3 years, depending on the state and quality. 
- We standardise the gear packages, following the news updates and models. 
This standardised gear suggestion can be changed according to needs and offers:

For all Abtioneers:
- 1 or 2 4K Screens (LG)

### setup at the office
Ideally, all desks and pairing stations have the same setup for an easy use by all. Flex desks for guests and Abtioneers who are not attached to their own desk or need a more/less quiet place on occasions. Personal desks for those who work the best at their own palace. Each desk consists of either 1 or 2 screens, keyboard + mouse, highrise. 

We administrate all gear in Asana (both in-house gear and gear you have at home.) ‘https://app.asana.com/0/1177794690825926/1197231131487319’ 

After approx. 3 years, when we reach the moment of replacing gear, we offer the possibility to buy Abtion's gear for perivate use for a ,of course, reasonable deducted price. Also, we are looking for a donation fund, to sponsor those who need it and find a useful 2nd life for our used gear. Any suggestions here? Shout out!

## Lunch and office snacks
We plan to take a lunch break at 11.30pm. We have daily catering delivering a tasty lunch for all our employees. There is enough variety to satisfy all kinds of diets and we are very open for new proposals. Besides lunch, you can always find something to snack on or to drink in our kitchens. If there is anything missing in your preference, don’t hesitate to reach out to our office managers/snack managers. 

Another important consuming product next to food, is coffee. At Abtion we love good coffee! Our passion makes us look out for good beans to provide a decent cup. We like variety and trying out new coffee from time to time, so if you have any suggestions in regards to that, don't be shy - please share it!


## Sampension

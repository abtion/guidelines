## Pension

Meeting with Sampension
After your first 3 months in Abtion, you become a member of our Health care and pension plan with Sampension. When being a part of the plan, you will get contacted by Sampension to book a counselling meeting. This will automatically happen after they have received your first payment. This payment has a standard of 8%, 6% by you and 2% by Abtion. 

So just sit back and relax, and wait for a phone call or email from Sampension. Do you have any questions in the meantime? Angelle knows all the answers.

## Lunch 
We plan to take a lunch break at 11.30pm. We have daily catering delivering a tasty lunch for all our employees. There is enough variety to satisfy all kinds of diets and we are very open for new proposals. Besides lunch, you can always find something to snack or to drink in our kitchens. If there is anything missing in your preference, don’t hesitate to reach out to Angelle. 

Another important consuming product next to food, is coffee. At Abtion we love good coffee! Our passion makes us look out for good beans to provide a decent cup. We like variety and try out new coffee from time to time, so if you have any suggestions according to that, don’t be shy and share it!

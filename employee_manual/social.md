## Our 4dww schedule
We have implemented 4day work week! Meaning, we work 30 hours from Monday to Thursday. In order to make the 4dww succeed, we align our schedules and meet at work earliest at 7:30 and the latest at 9:00. Your day finishes after 7,5 hours of work excluding a 30 min lunch break from 11.30 -12.00.

We only work 4 days a week by default, and have Fridays off. There are 2 exceptions you should be aware of. As first, our 5 internal days per year will be held on Fridays and are mandatory for all employees. Second, when a public holiday takes place on a weekday from Monday to Thursday, we will use Friday as a compensation day to keep 4 working days per week. 

## Lunch 
We plan to take a lunch break at 11.30pm. We have daily catering delivering a tasty lunch for all our employees. There is enough variety to satisfy all kinds of diets and we are very open for new proposals. Besides lunch, you can always find something to snack or to drink in our kitchens. If there is anything missing in your preference, don’t hesitate to reach out to Angelle. 

Another important consuming product next to food, is coffee. At Abtion we love good coffee! Our passion makes us look out for good beans to provide a decent cup. We like variety and try out new coffee from time to time, so if you have any suggestions according to that, don’t be shy and share it!

## Team days
Every other month, we use a Friday to have an internal day. We differ in two kinds of internal days:  Team days and Strategy day.


Team days will always happen on a Friday. It is mandatory to participate and we expect you to participate. If you can’t participate in a Team day, your absence is counted as a vacation day, unless you are absent due to sickness.

Team days strive to have a theme. 'Summer party' and 'Christmas party' are themes. These are not extra parties but are part of the few planned team days a year.

### Team days
For the four team days we all get together at one of our offices. The day is about team building, being together and getting to know each other even better. It is also a day, where we follow up on strategy and plans for the company. Two days are 1) Summer party and Christmas parties (half days). The two other days are 50 % business and 50 % fun and full days. 

Team days often have different agendas. But we start eating breakfast together, and end the day with dinner and drinks. Sometimes we invite an interesting person to come and give a presentation, or sometimes we go on a trip together. The goal is to have fun and improve our social relations and apprise you with plans, we may not get to talk so much about during regular work days.

### Strategy day
One day a year where we work on the strategy together. A full day with a focus on our vision, wheel of the year, and town hall workshops. Afterward, we round up with a cozy dinner and a social get-together.

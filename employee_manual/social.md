## Our 4dww schedule
We have implemented 4day work week! Meaning, we work 30 hours from Monday to Thursday. In order to make the 4dww succeed, we align our schedules and meet at work earliest at 7:30 and the latest at 9:00. Your day finishes after 7,5 hours of work excluding a 30 min lunch break from 11.30 -12.00.

We only work 4 days a week by default, and have Fridays off. There are 2 exceptions you should be aware of. As first, our 5 internal days per year will be held on Fridays and are mandatory for all employees. Second, when a public holiday takes place on a weekday from Monday to Thursday, we will use Friday as a compensation day to keep 4 working days per week. 


## Social Media
These days it is all about Social Media and we are not staying behind. Give us a hand by promoting our posts to Like, follow and connect with Abtion on Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.

To make our SoMe successful, it is as valuable to have a wide amount of followers and likes as good content and regular posting. Therefore it is appreciated if you share relevant ideas and information that can be used on our SoMe. Think about events, workshops, applications, etc. that relate to our business or work. Feel free to contact Angelle regarding this, or check SoMe project in Asana.

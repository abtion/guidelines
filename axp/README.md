## Pair programming

### Committing as a pair

We are using [git pair script from pivotal-legacy](https://github.com/pivotal-legacy/git_scripts)

```
gem install pivotal_git_scripts
```

See more setup instructions in the repo (RubyMine etc).

### Using different keyboard layouts

To ease the use of different keyboards with different languages on the ***same laptop*** then we recommend using [Autokbisw - Automatic keyboard input source switcher](https://github.com/jeantil/autokbisw)

Have XCode installed and do `brew install jeantil/autokbisw/autokbisw`. Then copy paste the `.plist` file from the repo to your `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`. Reboot and enjoy typing.

To set a keyboard to a specific langauge: Type something with the keyboard so it's the last active used - then change the language. That's it!

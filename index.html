    <p>
      The guidelines are extracted from real problems we encountered and the solutions we have found
      along the way. These guidelines should be used as a default unless there is a good reason
      against it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
    <p>
      These guidelines are created with the help of the whole organization. Anyone is welcome to
      open a PR to any section of the guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>Anything added to the guideline must have been extracted from a project.</p>

# How to purchase licenses or memberships and how to document this?

1) Ask for approval when needed. (Angelle, your PM or manager)
Look at this from a reflective angle, to make sure we buy the right license and to keep the commmunication and purchasing transperant. This makes it is easier to refer to the person responsible in case questions pop up. In general we approave all purchases.

2) Create a user that can be accessed by an admin: (This for a smooth on- and offboarding process)
   - admin@abtion.com + generate a code in 1pw + save it in the right vault. 
     - The right vault could be a 'team' or 'Software licences' when it is a common license.  
   - personal abtion email + generate a code in 1pw + save it in the right vault.
   - when several licenses are bought for the same account, a manager license might be needed to keep a better overview and reassign/cancel single licenses. Check this on forehand and reach out to Angelle when you have any questions. 
  
3) Create a billing email: (This to have one place to gather invoices/receipts)
   - admin+billing+<name_of_product>@abtion.com
   - when not able to create a billing email, 
      - use either admin@abtion.com as login, this will automatically direct the invoices to the right email
      - Use your private abtion email and redirect the incomming invoices to admin+billing@abtion.com (This only preferred when admin@abtion as login is not an option.)

4) Use the card credentials in 1pw in 'Shared Vault' under 'admin+billing@abiton.com'
   - For bigger purchases, pleo might ask for a verification via 2fa, reach out to Angelle for assistance in this case. 

5) Update the license overview in Asana 
   - Place the info in the right section: 
      - Internal licenses (services and shared accounts/licenses for internal use, internal tools) 
      - Individual licenses (for individual use, f.eks. grammarly or workflowy) 
      - Projects (create a new section with the project name, this for easy hand-off and clear overview of used tools per project/team)
      - Other clients and wordpress (Licenses for 'smaller' clients and all WP related licenses)
   - Fill out all the fields and write a comment when you have any questions. 
  
6) ##This board calls for shared ownership! 
Meaning, when you purchase a license, you care the responsibility to update the board and to upgrade/downgrade/re-assign the license in the future. This becomes accurate when you are switching project, or when a personal license becomes irrelevant. Also, when you need a license, check the board to see if there already excist a license. In this case you might be able to share login, or buy a manager membership to gather all purchases in 1 account. 

And add any licenses to the overview when it is missing. Your contribution means a lot!

# Estimating
Estimates are key to what we do.
We are in the business of selling software creation hours :) We want to do this as inexpensively as possible while also maintaining a healthy revenue for growth and down times. As a group, we need to hold appropriate tension between cost and quality. PMs and DEVs play a critical role in holding that tension, and communicating effectively with each other about it.

##Different estimates

There are three type of estimates:
- Ballpark estimates for early-stage projects
- Iteration estimate
- One-off estimate of a maintenance project

Although depending on the estimate, we will have a sliglthy different process, the essence and general guidelines are the same.

## Derive duration
We focus on Size estimates (how much) not duration estimates (how long). Related, but useful independently.
Estimates are a combination of effort, risk, complexity, etc. Separating size from duration enables agility in scheduling and iteration planning.



## Iteration estimate
Start with a very small story that you'll work with = small. Medium is 2x small. Large is 2x medium. (Thus, small = 1/4 large.) More advanced estimators may pick their own number scale to better fit the work.
Do work for an iteration and derive a velocity to create your schedule. Team finishes 1 large and 2 mediums per iteration as X capacity... recalculate velocity weekly. Velocity is expected to be between .5 and 1.6x expectation at the start of a project, and closer to .8-1.1 near the end. As we know more, velocity estimates will tighten.

Note, if you have a bit of work that the team does not know how to estimate, put a “spike card” in the backlog. A “spike” is like doing research. 

Align estimates on ideal time (“this will take 5 days”) vs wall time (“this will actually take 7 including the tasks I have with hiring, speaking to the client/vendors, updating underlying libraries etc”). Be sure to include/think about testing as part of the estimate.
There is a law of diminishing returns with estimates. At some point, you will spend a lot of time on them and not greatly increase accuracy. You need to see each estimate as a probability, and to spend enough time estimating to get to a probability your client is comfortable with. Remember: You will never get 100% accuracy; maybe 80%. Remember: 10% of the effort in estimating gets you 50% of the way.
Create a schedule buffer. Different from padding, a buffer is added after thinking through the relative risks with the team: what do people have going on? How complicated are the integrations?
Communicate to the client with percentages: I'm 95% sure we'll be done with these agreed on stories by X. Or: based on our current assumptions, this should take 3-4 months with a team of this size.


Advocate team culture
When you win and lose together, your estimates get even better. 

Estimates should be based on skills of the whole team. Take the highest estimate for the team.
Estimates should be made by two developers at a minimum; estimates are shared, and ideally by the implementing team.
When story estimates are not matching delivery expectations with the given probability, seek to understand why and bring knowledge into action items to improve team process.

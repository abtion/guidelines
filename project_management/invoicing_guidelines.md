# Invoicing guidelines 

Disclaimer: To be able to work your way through this guide you must be a PM in harvest and have access to Visma Economic (right now for PM + management)

## Overall plan:

1. All hours tracked
   
Make sure that everyone has filled out their timesheet for the whole month which means min. 30 hours a week througout monday until thursday. Check Timetracking here for more info.

2. Check all non-billable
   
When we have verified that all have filled out their timesheets completely she tells to PM to check non-billable hours to ensure nothing have been marked wrong. The filter in harvest is right here [Harvest](https://abtion.harvestapp.com/reports/detailed?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group=projects&billable=no&roles%5B%5D=478328&roles%5B%5D=474751&roles%5B%5D=638560&roles%5B%5D=478324&roles%5B%5D=665565&roles%5B%5D=478326) - remember to change to actual month!

3. Make the invoices

When PM have run through non-billable hours and changed relevant hours to billable let the invoiving begin which means export hours from Harvest to E-conomic as drafts.

4. Submit the invoices

When everyone has emptied Harvest for all billable hours, we have a final validation of the draft invoices in E-conomic to make sure that each of them has the correct data so we increase the chances of getting paid at the right time.

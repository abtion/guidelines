## 1password
A password manager remembering them all for you. Logs you into (almost) all our apps. 
Along with a shared vault, will you have storage for your own private passwords. In order to keep the shared vault up to date, you are enabled to update new passwords. 

In 1pw you can find log-in credentials to internal stuff like WiFi-code, internal used applications and access to project related data. 

This guideline:[abtion.github.io](https://abtion.github.io/guidelines/tools_and_services/managing_access_to_1pw_vaults_and_project_data.html) introduces you to our way of working with 1pw. 
The magic to keep it all nice and tight â€” We educate ourselves to be our own gatekeeper. Everyone is actively contributing to the main rules and culture.

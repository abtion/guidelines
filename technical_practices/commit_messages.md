# Commit Messages

The most important information in commit messages is *why* you made the change.

Nice to have:

* Summary of the changes (it helps when going back in history and trying to decide whether a change was accidentally added to commit).
* Thoughts about decisions you made.
* Links to Asana task, or other relevant info like a Github bug report, stackoverflow, etc.
* Keep the headline less than 50 characters, if possible.

> To come up with thoughtful commits, consider the following:
> * Why have I made these changes?
> * What effect have my changes made?
> * Why was the change needed?
> * What are the changes in reference to?

# Development Kickoff - Full day, Whole Team

Starting a few weeks after any needed design starts. Entire team is present, including design, client, pm. May cover up to ~3 months of work.

Come away with:

- Solid understanding of why we are building X
- Understand the “enough” line (when have we built enough for the client to start using and get feedback on the product?)
- Find the landmines or “anti-goals” which keep us from reaching the goals
  - Ex: is mobile optimization an anti-goal?
- Understand tech requirements and platforms
- Understand users and how they flow through the app
- Review wireframes + user research : personas, mood boards, brand guidelines, prototypes, copywriting info, styles guides. Put these in gdrive or in pinned slack notes so everyone can find them.
- Create roadmap together with stories
- Identify mini-releases along the way
- Create and sign off on GDPR expectations
what data will we persist and how long? Also how will it be exported or deleted?

- What video format do we need in order to fit both mobile, tablet and desktop?

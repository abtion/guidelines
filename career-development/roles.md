# Roles

At Abtion we wear many hats. As physical hats, you don't always wear the same hat. The role of a person in a project may differ from the role the same person has on a different project.

The following descriptions are indications of what is expecting of a person having a role. The responsibilities are not unique to the person on this role. On the contrary, it is expected that all team members contribute to the well functioning of the team and the company. The list of responsibilities is the guidance that allows all the teammates to know what is everyone's role.

## Project Lead
- Be a product owner substitute.
- Be the decision-maker when conflicts arise.
- Create an atmosphere where people share their doubts, concerns, and opinions.
- Integrate all participants in the project.
- Sense when a team member is lagging behind and take action.
- Know the core strengths and weaknesses of all team members.
- Make sure that a single person does not hold too much responsibility.
- Ensure that all developers enjoy the codebase (TDDed, well maintained, sane dependencies, etc.).
- Make smart choices in regards to the budget.
- Cheer up the team when needed. Do not let pessimism sink the project.

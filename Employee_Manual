# Employee Manual Abtion 

## Introduction
Welcome to Abtion's employee manual. The purpose of the manual is to provide you with practical information about your workplace, and the company culture.

We ask you to read the manual thoroughly. If there is something that you miss the answer to or would like us to elaborate, please do not hesitate to ask.

Happy reading.

## Our values
At Abtion we believe in the individual's ability to take responsibility and desire to do its best. Therefore, we want our behavior and work to be governed by values rather than rules. 

We wish that everyone at Abtion strives to be:

- ambitious
- competent
- value-creating
 - effective

… and at the same time have fun. It should be fun and enjoyable to go to work in Abtion. If something comes in the way of fun, if it's suddenly not enjoyable to go to the office, it is important that you draw attention to it, so we can take care of the problem together.


## 1password
A password manager remembering them all for you. Logs you into (almost) all our apps. Along with a shared vault, will you have storage for your own private passwords.
In order to keep the shared vault up to date, you are enabled to update new passwords. In 1pw you can find the log-in to internal stuff like WiFi but also project acess. 
Remember to add the extension to Chrome.

Managing access to 1pw and project data
Manage access and guard our login credentials

There is a new guideline in [abtion.github.io](https://abtion.github.io/guidelines/tools_and_services/managing_access_to_1pw_vaults_and_project_data.html)

With this guideline, we introduce you to our new way of being more structured and secure with sensitive data and login credentials.

The magic to keep it all nice and tight — We educate ourselves to be our own gatekeeper. Everyone is actively contributing to the main rules and culture.

When asking permission to grant access to fx. Heroku or 1pw vaults, ALSO ask to be removed after a reasonable time finishing the task.
Only have access to the data and vaults that you are actively working on
Ask to eliminate access when you can enter data/vaults of projects you are not working on.
1password has an essential role in keeping us structured and secure. Have a look at the guidelines as they describe how we use 1pw, organize the vaults, manage access, and how we keep it aligned with the license overview.
